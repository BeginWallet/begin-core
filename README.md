# Begin Core - Crypto SDK

Welcome to **Begin Wallet** cryptographic core sdk. This package is responsible to handle all the crypto prmitives required to Create Wallets, Build and Sign Transactions as well as Sign Messages.

You can also verify how we handle and use your Private Key AKA `Root Key`.

Our SDK is based on [`dcSpark - CML`](https://github.com/dcSpark/cardano-multiplatform-lib/tree/develop)

## Modules

### Core
* Account
* Address
* Transaction

### Crypto
* Mnemonic

### Utils
* Encryption

## Commands

This library is built on `Typescript` using TSDX and the source can be found at `/src`.

To run, use:

```bash
npm start or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

## Configuration

Code quality is set up for you with `prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged`. Adjust the respective fields in `package.json` accordingly.

### Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### > ***ATTENTION***

Unit test may need it, if you get Out of memory.
```
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
```

### Bundle Analysis

[`size-limit`](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) is set up to calculate the real cost of your library with `npm run size` and visualize the bundle with `npm run analyze`.


### Rollup

TSDX uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as a bundler and generates multiple rollup configs for various module formats and build settings. See [Optimizations](#optimizations) for details.

### TypeScript

`tsconfig.json` is set up to interpret `dom` and `esnext` types, as well as `react` for `jsx`. Adjust according to your needs.

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions

Two actions are added by default:

- `main` which installs deps w/ cache, lints, tests, and builds on all pushes against a Node and OS matrix
- `size` which comments cost comparison of your library on every pull request using [`size-limit`](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)

## Optimizations

Please see the main `tsdx` [optimizations docs](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#optimizations). In particular, know that you can take advantage of development-only optimizations:

```js
// ./types/index.d.ts
declare var __DEV__: boolean;

// inside your code...
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log('foo');
}
```

You can also choose to install and use [invariant](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#invariant) and [warning](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#warning) functions.

## Module Formats

CJS, ESModules, and UMD module formats are supported.

The appropriate paths are configured in `package.json` and `dist/index.js` accordingly. Please report if any issues are found.

## Named Exports

Per Palmer Group guidelines, [always use named exports.](https://github.com/palmerhq/typescript#exports) Code split inside your React app instead of your React library.


## Publishing to NPM

We recommend using [np](/NPM_PUBLISH.md).
